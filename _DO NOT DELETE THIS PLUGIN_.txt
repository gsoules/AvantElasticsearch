The AvantS3 plugin depends on the existence of this AvantElasticsearch folder which
contains the vendor/aws libraries that AvantS3 needs.

The AvantElasticsearch plugin does not need to be installed in order for AvantS3 to work.

Ideally, the AWS libraries should get move into the AvantS3 plugin so that this
AvantElasticsearch plugin can be removed.
